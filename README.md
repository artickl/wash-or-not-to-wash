# Wash-or-not-to-Wash
Should I wash my car today or not?

## General idea
If you have a car, how often are you asking yourself a question if you should wash your car today or not? How often are you catching yourself in the thought that if you washed your car a couple days ago - you will be able to enjoy a clean car during all these sunny days? How often you wash the car and rain starts the same day or day after?

Of cause you can avoid all of it by constantly checking weather app, but how convenient will be if your phone will do it for you?

### Regular steps, process and issues
Steps:
1) Open your phone - check the weather forecast for next couple days
2) Drive somewhere
3) Verify if your car is dirty or not
4) Find a time to wash your car
5) Find a place where to wash the car

Process:
can be a combination of all steps in any order, but my two common workflows are:
1. **wash a car on Saturday**:
- During the week realize that it's a time to wash your car
- plan ahead to have a time to wash your car on Saturday
- on Saturday morning check the weather
- if the weather is good - go and wash your car
- if the weather is bad - relax and get a cup of nice warm tee
2. **wash a car of the go**:
- pass by car wash place
- check the status of the car
- wash the car
- hope that no rain in next couple days

Issues:
1. for **Saturday** plan - you allocating time in advance, which can be used better, plus you need to go and wash your car when actually you don't need to go somewhere else (or you trying to find where to go)
2. for **on the go** plan - not always able to check the weather app on time

## How to improve
Special application:
1. Getting to the car and start driving somewhere
2. Phone realizing that you going somewhere
3. Phone checking the weather
4. If nice weather ahead - phone is notifying about it

Optionally:
1. The app can check when last time you wash the car based on Google information (visits) or based on user input
2. The app can know your preferred washing place and do it when you drive towards it (plus it can check how busy that place is, based on google information)
3. The app can show if any promotions are available for some specific place (like early morning discounts or something else)

## Monetize ideas
1. local car wash places can advertise promotions via app
2. most calculation can be done on the phone side which allows free google map API usage (technically no server side application required, which minimizes the cost of supporting the app)
